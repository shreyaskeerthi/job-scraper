# job-scraper
Python Scraper for job listings from online forums.


## Currently:
* Simple scraping
* Hard coded location and roles
* needs to be run prior to encoding in the RAG-jobber .ipynb

## Next fixes:
* Automated scraping
* User inputted params
* Pipeline directly into RAG and connect
* Continuous context enrichment
